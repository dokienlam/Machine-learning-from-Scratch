Welcome to Machine Learning from Scratch! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and implementation of various machine learning algorithms built entirely from scratch. Below are the main sections of the project, covering deep learning, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning, along with the algorithms developed within each category.

1. Deep Learning:
   
This section focuses on building neural networks and deep learning models without relying on external libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Algorithms may include:

    Perceptron
    
    Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
    
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    
    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    
    Deep Q-Network (DQN)
    
    Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

2. Reinforcement Learning:
   
Here, the emphasis is on implementing reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch to train agents to interact with environments and maximize rewards. Algorithms may include:

    Q-Learning
    
    Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
    
    Policy Gradient Methods
    
    Actor-Critic Methods

3. Supervised Learning:
   
In this section, traditional supervised learning algorithms are developed, focusing on training models to learn patterns and make predictions from labeled data. Algorithms may include:

    Linear Regression
    
    Logistic Regression
    
    Decision Trees
    
    Random Forests
    
    k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
    
    Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    
    Naive Bayes

4. Unsupervised Learning:
   
This section covers algorithms designed to identify patterns and structures within unlabeled data. Algorithms may include:

    K-means Clustering
    
    Hierarchical Clustering
    
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    
    t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    
    Autoencoders
